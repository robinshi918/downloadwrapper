## Intro
This is a project for my family's requirement of music listening. As mostly we can find almost all the music resources from YouTube, I wrote this application to utilize the powerful youtube-dl tool. I hope this tool can help my family members to access the music resource in a convenient way. 

There are 2 servers needed: FTP and Subsoni which are supposed to be on same physical computer.


## Features

- Download mp3 file from YouTube by calling youtube-dl
- Upload downloaded mp3 file to a FTP server
- Force Subsonic server to scan the new media, so this new mp3 music is available to Subsonic clients immediately.
